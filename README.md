## Offline Mode explanation

So when you load the app first time , It will check in a folder called ```/batch``` , If file doesnt exist it takes you in the app .

there are Three options

### Checkin
In this you can scan the product to checkin to your warehouse

when a product is scanned it gets added to the file called ```product.json``` situated inside ```batch``` folder.

the object looks like this 

```
{ 
	name :'someRandomName'
	code:'scannedbarcode',
	timmeStamp:'you current time in YYYY DD MM HH:MM:SS',
	direction:"In"
}
```

### Checkout

When you are sending the Product from your warehouse to customer, you can use checkout option to scan the products.

The object Structure looks like this

```
{ 
	name :'someRandomName'
	code:'scannedbarcode',
	timmeStamp:'you current time in YYYY DD MM HH:MM:SS',
	direction:"Out"
}
```

### Sync

When you are done with scanning products you can use this option to push it to backend server.
So when the file ```product.json``` is sent to server it will be delted for new batch.


## Use Case

The major use case could be Remote Warehouses facilities where internet is not good.
So you can finish the stock scan and sync the data on a later point of time when in network

So example of offline mode workflow.
